# Overview
Data journalist Dana is writing a story covering the strange phenomena of UFO sightings in her hometown McMinnville, OR. She provided JavaScript source file, and desires to grant access to online users so that they can interact with the dataset. Since her webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, she now wants to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to 'date', table filters for the city have been added [state, country, and shape]. Dana's webpage is focused on Javascript.
